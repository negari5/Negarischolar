# Negari Scholar Platform

**Dream Bold. Apply Smart.**

Negari Scholar is a student-first digital platform designed to guide African students, starting with Ethiopia, through the complex journey of discovering, preparing for, and winning scholarships. It acts as a smart companion from the moment a student dreams of studying abroad to the moment they submit applications and beyond.

Negari is not just a directory. It is a guided journey.
